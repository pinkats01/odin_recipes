        <p>Everyone needs a basic spaghetti bolognese recipe that still tastes great,<br>
            no matter how simple. Get that depth of flavour by cooking the sauce very gently until it’s super rich.<br>
            This spag bol is designed to be a low cost recipe.</p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>         
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>400g/14oz beef mince</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced </li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped </li>
            <li>100g/3½oz carrot, grated</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do) </li>
            <li>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince<br>
                and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not<br>
                to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions<br>
                and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for<br>
                another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature<br>
                to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li> 
            <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the<br>
                packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
