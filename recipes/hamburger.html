        <p>Chunky Italian Spaghetti Sauce</p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>         
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate</li>
            <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl.<br> 
                Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of <br>feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. 
                Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done.<br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li> 
        </ol>
